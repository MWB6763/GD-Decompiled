# GD-Decompiled
 An attempt to get the source code for Geometry Dash through reverse engineering and decompiling the game.  

## IMPORTANT

- This Project is intended to be used as reference material to assist with modding. 
- This repository is <b>not</b> a matching decompilation
- As the code is not compilable, there may be errors in the syntax.

Classes that I've pushed but haven't finished will be found in [Issues](https://github.com/Wyliemaster/GD-Decompiled/issues).

## Buy GD

If for some reason you haven't already I recommend you go and buy GD
